# iEEG_Probe_Marker_Tool

This tool was created to save time marking iEEG elctrodes' probe locations
it semi-automates theselection process, and fully automates XYZ coordinates extraction

currently requires additional testing, but can be used for basic electrode marking tasks.

feel free to ask for new features, i'll hopefully be able to make them part of the project if i find them helpfull.
